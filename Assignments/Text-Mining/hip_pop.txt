['It\'s like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder\nHow I keep from going under\nIt\'s like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder\nHow I keep from going under\n\nBroken glass everywhere\nPeople pissing on the stairs, you know they just don\'t care\nI can\'t take the smell, can\'t take the noise\nGot no money to move out, I guess I got no choice\n\nRats in the front room, roaches in the back\nJunkies in the alley with a baseball bat\nI tried to get away, but I couldn\'t get far\n\'Cause the man with the tow-truck repossessed my car\n\nDon\'t push me, \'cause I\'m close to the edge\nI\'m trying not to lose my head\nHa-ha-ha-ha\n\nIt\'s like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder\nHow I keep from going under\n\nStanding on the front stoop, hangin out the window\nWatching all the cars go by, roaring as the breezes blow\nA crazy lady, livin in a bag\nEating out of garbage piles, used to be a fag-hag\n\nSaid, she danced the tango, skipped the light fandango\nWas circon princess, seemed to lost her senses\nDown at the peepshow, watching all the creeps\nSo she can tell the stories to the girls back home\n\nShe went to the city and got Social Security\nShe had to get a pimp, she couldn\'t make it on her own\n\nDon\'t push me, \'cause I\'m close to the edge\nI\'m trying not to lose my head\nHa-ha-ha-ha\n\nIt\'s like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder\nHow I keep from going under\nIt\'s like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder\nHow I keep from going under\n\nMy brothers doin\' bad, stole my mothers TV\nSays, she watches to much, is just not healthy\n"All my children" in the daytime, "Dallas" at night\nCan\'t even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight\n\nThe bill collectors, they ring my phone\nAnd scare my wife when I\'m not home\nGot a bum education, double-digit inflation\nCan\'t take the train to the job, there\'s a strike at the station\n\nNeon king kong standin\' on my back\nCan\'t stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac\nA midrange migraine, cancered membrane\nSometimes I think I\'m going insane, I swear I might hijack a plane\n\nDon\'t push me, \'cause I\'m close to the edge\nI\'m trying not to lose my head\n\nIt\'s like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder\nHow I keep from going under\nIt\'s like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder\nHow I keep from going under\n\nMy son said, "daddy, I don\'t wanna go to school\nCause the teacher\'s a jerk, he must think I\'m a fool\nAnd all the kids smoke reefer, I think it\'d be cheaper\nIf I just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper\n\nI dance to the beat, shuffle my feet\nWear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps\n\'Cause it\'s all about money, ain\'t a damn thing funny\nYou got to have a con in this land of milk and honey\n\nThey pushed that girl in front of the train\nTook her to the doctor, sewed the arm on again\nStabbed that man right in his heart\nGave him a transplant for a brand new start\n\nI can\'t walk through the park, \'cause it\'s crazy after the dark\nKeep my hand on the gun, \'cause they got me on the run\nI feel like an outlaw, broke my last glass jaw\nHear them say you want some more, livin on a seesaw\n\nDon\'t push me, \'cause I\'m close to the edge\nI\'m trying not to lose my head\n\nIt\'s like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder\nHow I keep from going under\nIt\'s like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder\nHow I keep from

state of mind\nBlind to the ways of mankind\nGod is smiling on you, but he\'s frowning too\nBecause only God knows what you go through\n\nYou grow in the ghetto, living second rate\nAnd your eyes will sing a song of deep hate\nThe place that you play and where you stay\nLooks like one great big alley way\n\nYou\'ll admire all the number book takers\nThugs, pimps and pushers and the big money makers\nDriving big cars, spending twenties and tens\nAnd you wanna grow up to be just like them, huh\n\nSmugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers\nPickpockets, peddlers and even panhandlers\nYou say I\'m cool, I\'m no fool\nBut then you wind up dropping out of high school\n\nNow you\'re unemployed, all null \'n void\nWalking \'round like you\'re Pretty Boy Floyd\nTurned stickup kid, look what you done did\nGot send up for a eight year bid\n\nNow your manhood is took and you\'re a may tag\nSpend the next two years as an undercover fag\nBeing used and abused and served like hell\nTill one day you was found hung dead in a cell\n\nIt was plain to see that your life was lost\nYou was cold and your body swung back and forth\nBut now your eyes sing the sad, sad song\nOf how you lived so fast and died so young\n\nSo, don\'t push me, \'cause I\'m close to the edge\nI\'m trying not to lose my head\n\nIt\'s like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder\nHow I keep from going under\nHuh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh\nIt\'s like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder\nHow I keep from going under\nHuh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh', 'I said-a hip, hop, the hippie, the hippie\nTo the hip hip

don\'t get weak\n\nI know a man named Hank\nHe has more rhymes than a serious bank\nSo come on, Hank, sing that song\nTo the rhythm of the boogie da bang bang da bong\n\nWell, I\'m imp the dimp, the ladies pimp\nThe women fight for my delight\nBut I\'m the grandmaster with the three MCs\nThat shock the house for the young ladies\n\nAnd when you come inside into the front\nYou do the freak, spank, and do the bump\nAnd when the sucker MCs try to prove a point\nWe\'re treacherous trio, we\'re the serious joint\n\nA-from sun-to-sun and from day-to-day\nI sit down and write a brand new rhyme\nBecause they say that miracles never cease\nI\'ve created a devastating masterpiece\nI\'m gonna rock the mic till you can\'t resist\nEverybody, I say, it goes like this:\n\nWell, I was comin\' home late one dark afternoon\nA reporter stopped me for a interview\nShe said she\'s heard stories and she\'s heard fables\nThat I\'m vicious on the mic and the turntables\n\nThis young reporter, I did adore\nSo I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did before\nShe said, "Damn, fly guy, I\'m in love with you!\nThe Cassanova legend must have been true!"\nI said, "By the way, baby, what\'s your name?"\nSaid, "I go by the name of Lois Lane\n\nAnd you could be my boyfriend, you surely can\nJust let me quit my boyfriend called Superman"\nI said, "He\'s a fairy, I do suppose\nFlyin\' through the air in pantyhose\n\nHe may be very sexy or even cute\nBut he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit"\nI said, "You need a man who\'s got finesse\nAnd his whole name across his chest\n\nHe may be able to fly all through the night\nBut can he rock a party till the early light?\nHe can\'t satisfy you with his little worm\nBut I can bust you out with my super sperm!"\n\nI gon\' do it, I gon\' do it\nI gon\' do it, do it, do it\nAnd I\'m here, and I\'m there\nI\'m Big Bank Hank, I\'m everywhere\n\nJust throw your hands up in the air\nAnd party hardy like you just don\'t care\nLet\'s do it, don\'t stop y\'all\nA-tick a-tock, y\'all, you don\'t stop!\n\nGo hotel, motel, what you gonna do today? (Say what?)\nI\'m gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank, drive off in a def OJ\nEverybody go hotel, motel, Holiday Inn\nYou say, if your girl starts actin\' up then you take her friend\n\nI say skip, dive, what can I say?\nI can\'t fit em all inside my OJ\nSo I just take half and bust them out\nI give the rest to Master Gee so he could shock the house\n\nIt was twelve o\'clock one Friday night\nI was rockin\' to the beat and feelin\' all right\nEverybody was dancin\' on the floor\nDoin\' all the things they never did before\n\nAnd then this fly, fly girl with a sexy lean\nShe came into the bar, she came into the scene\nAs she traveled deeper inside the room\nAll the fellas checked out her white sasoons\n\nShe came up to the table, looked into my eyes\nThen she turned around and shook her behind\nSo I said to myself, "It\'s time for me to release\nMy vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece"\n\nAnd now, people in the house, this is just for you\nA little rap to make you boogaloo\nNow the group ya hear is called phase two\nAnd let me tell ya somethin\', we\'re a helluva crew\n\nOnce a week we\'re on the street\nJust a-cuttin\' the jams and making it free\nFor you to party, ya got to have the moves\nSo we\'ll get right down and give you a groove\n\nFor you to dance, you gotta get hype\nSo we\'ll get right down and make you rock\nNow the system\'s on and the girls are there\nYa definitely have a rockin affair\n\nBut let me tell ya somethin\', there\'s still one fact:\nThat to have a party, ya got to have a rap\nSo when the party\'s over, you\'re makin\' it home\nAnd tryin\' to sleep before the break of dawn\n\nAnd while ya sleepin\', ya start to dream\nAnd thinkin\' how ya danced on the disco scene\nMy name appears in your mind\nYeah, a name you know that was right on time\n\nIt was phase two, just a-doin\' a do\nRockin\' ya down \'cause ya know we could\nTo the rhythm of the beat that makes ya freak\nCome alive, girls, get on your feet\n\nTo the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat\nTo the double beat beat that it makes ya freak\nTo the rhythm of the beat that says ya go on\nOn n on into the break of dawn\n\nNow I got a man comin\' on right now\nHe\'s guaranteed to throw down\nHe goes by the name of Wonder Mike\nCome on, Wonder Mike, do what ya like\n\nLike a can of beer that\'s sweeter than honey\nLike a millionaire that has no money\nLike a rainy day that is not wet\nLike a gamblin\' fiend that does not bet\n\nLike Dracula without his fangs\nLike the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang\nLike collard greens that don\'t taste good\nLike a tree that\'s not made out of wood\n\nLike goin\' up and not comin\' down\nIs just like the beat without the sound, no sound\nTo the beat beat, ya do The Freak\nEverybody just rock and dance to the beat\n\nHave you ever went over a friends house to eat\nAnd the food just ain\'t no good?\nI mean the macaroni\'s soggy, the peas are mushed\nAnd the chicken tastes like wood\n\nSo you try to play it off like you think you can\nBy sayin that you\'re full\nAnd then your friend says, "Momma, he\'s just being polite\nHe ain\'t finished, uh uh, that\'s bull!"\n\nSo your heart starts pumpin\', and you think of a lie\nAnd you say that you already ate\nAnd your friend says, "Man, there\'s plenty of food!"\nSo you pile some more on your plate\n\nWhile the stinky foods steamin\' your mind starts to dreamin\'\nOf the moment that it\'s time to leave\nAnd then you look at your plate and your chickens slowly rottin\'\nInto something that looks like cheese\n\nOh so, you say, "That\'s it, I got to leave this place\nI don\'t care what these people think\nI\'m just sittin\' here makin\' myself nauseous\nWith this ugly food that stinks!"\n\nSo you bust out the door while it\'s still closed\nStill sick from the food you ate\nAnd then you run to the store for quick relief\nFrom a bottle of Kaopectate\n\nAnd then you call your friend two weeks later\nTo see how he has been\nAnd he says, "I understand about the food, baby bubbah\nBut we\'re still friends"\n\nWith a hip hop, the hippie to the hippie\nThe hip hip-a hop-a you don\'t stop the rockin\'\nTo the bang bang boogie say up jump the boogie\nTo the rhythm of the boogie the beat\n\nI say, Hank, can ya rock?\nCan ya rock to the rhythm that just don\'t stop?\nCan ya hip me to the shoobie doo?\nI said, come on make the, make the people move\n\nI go to the halls and then ring the bell\nBecause I am the man with the clientele\nAnd if ya ask me why I rock so well\nA big bang, I got clientele\n\nAnd from the time I was only six years old\nI never forgot what I was told\nIt was the best advice that I ever had\nIt came from my wise dear old dad\n\nHe said, "Sit down, punk, I wanna talk to you\nAnd don\'t say a word until I\'m through\nNow, there\'s a time to laugh, a time to cry\nA time to live and a time to die\n\nA time to break and a time to chill\nTo act civilized or act real ill\nBut whatever ya do in your lifetime\nY\'never let a MC steal your rhyme!"\n\nSo from sixty-six to this very day\nI\'ll always remember what he had to say\nSo when the sucker MCs try to chump my style\nI let them know that I\'m versatile\n\nI got style, finesse and a little black book\nThat\'s filled with rhymes and I know you wanna look\nBut there\'s a thing that separates you from me\nAnd that is called originality\n\nBecause my rhymes are on from what you heard\nI didn\'t even bite and not a Goddamn word\nAnd I say a little more later on tonight\nSo the sucker MCs can bite all night\n\nA-tick a-tock y\'all, a-beat beat y\'all\nA-let\'s rock y\'all, ya don\'t stop\nYa go hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today? (Say what?)\nYa say I\'m gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spankin\'\nDrive off in a def OJ\nEverybody go hotel, motel, Holiday Inn\nYa say if your girl starts actin\' up, then you take her friends\n\nA-like that y\'all, to the beat y\'all\nBeat beat ya\'ll, ya don\'t stop\nA-Master Gee, am I mellow?\nIt\'s on you, so whatcha gonna do?\n\nWell, like Johnny Carson on The Late Show\nA-like Frankie Crocker in stereo\nWell, like The Bar-Kay\'s singin\' Holy Ghost\nThe sounds to throw down, they\'re played the most\n\nIt\'s like my man, Captain Sky\nWhose name he earned with his super sperm\nWe rock and we don\'t stop\nGet off, y\'all, I\'m here to give you whatcha got\nTo the beat that it makes you freak\nAnd come alive, girl, get on your feet\n\nA-like a Perry Mason without a case\nLike Farrah Fawcett without her face\nLike The Bar-Kays on the mic\nLike gettin\' right down for you tonight\n\nLike movin\' your body so ya don\'t know how\nRight to the rhythm and throw down\nLike comin\' alive to the Master Gee\nThe brother who rocks so viciously\n\nI said, the age of one, my life begun\nAt the age of two, I was doin the\' do\nAt the age of three, it was you and me\nRockin\' to the sounds of the Master Gee\n\nAt the age of four, I was on the floor\nGivin\' all the freaks what they bargained for\nAt the age of five, I didn\'t take no jive\nWith the Master Gee, it\'s all the way live\n\nAt the age of six, I was a-pickin\' up sticks\nRappin\' to the beat, my stick was fixed\nAt the age of seven, I was rockin\' in heaven\nDontcha know I went off?\n\nI got right on down to the beat, you see\nGettin\' right on down, makin\' all the girls\nJust take of their clothes to the beat the beat\nTo the double beat beat that makes you freak\n\nAt the age of eight, I was really great\n\'Cause every night, you see I had a date\nAt the age of nine, I was right on time\n\'Cause every night, I had a party rhyme\n\nGoin\' on n n on n on on n on\nThe beat don\'t stop until the break of dawn\nA-sayin\' on n n on n on on n on...\nLike a hot buttered de pop de pop de pop\nA-saying on n n on n on on n on\nI say you don\'t stop, gimme what ya got\n\'Cause I\'m a helluva man when I\'m on the mic\nI am the definite feast delight\n\'Cause I\'m a helluva man when i\'m on the miC\nI am the definite feast delight\nCome to the Master Gee, you see\nThe brother who rocks so viciously', "Party people, party people\nCan y'all get funky?\nSoul Sonic Force can y'll get funky?\nThe Zulu Nation can y'll get funky?\nJust hit me, just taste the funk and hit me\nJust get on down and hit me\nBambaataa's jus' gettin' \nSo funky, now, hit me just hit me\n\nJust start to chase your dreams\nUp out your seats, make your body sway\nSocialize, get down, let your soul lead the way\nShake it now, go ladies, it's a livin' dream\nLove life, live come play the game\nOur world is free do what you want but scream\n\nWe know a place where the nights are hot\nIt is a house of funk\nFemales and males both headed all for the disco\nThe DJ plays your favorite blasts\nTakes you back to the past, music's magic (poof)\nBump bump bump get bump with some flash, people\n\nRock rock to the Planet Rock\nDon't stop\nRock rock to the Planet Rock\nDon't stop\n\nThe Soul Sonic Force, Mr. Biggs, Pow Wow and M.
