Variables: 
- Dynamic by nature

int(variable) - casts variable to integer
str(variable) - casts variable to string
float(variable) - casts variable to float (number with decimal)
---------

Operators: 
- Used to vaguely describ 5 different areas: 
    1. arithmetic (* multiplication) (** to the power)
    2. assingment (=)
    3. increment/decrement (+ or /)
        - '+' can be used to concatenate strings
    4. comparison (>, <, <=, >=)
    5. logical
        - // is floor division: just divides # and rounds down
    5. Modulus operator (%)
        - it divides the left side by the right side and get the remainder.
            Remainder is what is returned and not hte # of times the right # went into operator 

*Assignemnt Operators Example 
 in:   a = 0
    a+=2
    print(a)

 out: 2    

    We just told Python to add 2 to the value of a without having to say something like a = a + 2

In Statement: 
- Condition that, when it is satisfied, activate some part of code. 
  Coupled with variables to produce more dynamic content.
